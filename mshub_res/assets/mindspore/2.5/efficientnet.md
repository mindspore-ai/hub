## Introduction

<!--- Guideline: Introduce the model and architectures. Please cite if you use/adopt paper explanation from others. -->
<!--- Guideline: If an architecture table/figure is available in the paper, please put one here and cite for intuitive illustration. -->

Figure 1 shows the methods from three dimensions -- width, depth, resolution and compound to expand the model. Increasing the model
size solely would cause the model performance to sub-optimal solution. However, if three methods could be applied together into the model
, it is more likely to achieve optimal solution. By using neural architecture search, the best configurations for width scaling, depth scaling
and resolution scaling could be found. EfficientNet could achieve better model performance on ImageNet-1K dataset compared with previous methods.[[1](#references)]

## Results

<!--- Guideline:
Table Format:

- Model: model name in lower case with _ separator.
- Context: Training context denoted as {device}x{pieces}-{MS mode}, where mindspore mode can be G - graph mode or F - pynative mode with ms function. For example, D910x8-G is for training on 8 pieces of Ascend 910 NPU using graph mode.
- Top-1 and Top-5: Keep 2 digits after the decimal point.
- Params (M): # of model parameters in millions (10^6). Keep 2 digits after the decimal point
- Recipe: Training recipe/configuration linked to a yaml config file. Use absolute url path.
- Download: url of the pretrained model weights. Use absolute url path.

Our reproduced model performance on ImageNet-1K is reported as follows.

### Notes

- Context: Training context denoted as {device}x{pieces}-{MS mode}, where mindspore mode can be G - graph mode or F - pynative mode with ms function. For example, D910x8-G is for training on 8 pieces of Ascend 910 NPU using graph mode.
- Top-1 and Top-5: Accuracy reported on the validation set of ImageNet-1K.

## Quick Start

### Preparation

#### Installation

Please refer to the [installation instruction](https://github.com/mindspore-lab/mindcv#installation) in MindCV.

#### Dataset Preparation

Please download the [ImageNet-1K](https://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/index.php) dataset for model training and validation.

### Training

<!--- Guideline: Please avoid using shell scripts in the command line. Python scripts preferred. -->

- Distributed Training

It is easy to reproduce the reported results with the pre-defined training recipe. For distributed training on multiple Ascend 910 devices, please run

```shell
# distributed training on multiple GPU/Ascend devices
mpirun -n 64 python train.py --config configs/efficientnet/efficientnet_b0_ascend.yaml --data_dir /path/to/imagenet
```

> If the script is executed by the root user, the `--allow-run-as-root` parameter must be added to `mpirun`.

Similarly, you can train the model on multiple GPU devices with the above `mpirun` command.

For detailed illustration of all hyper-parameters, please refer to [config.py](https://github.com/mindspore-lab/mindcv/blob/main/config.py).

**Note:** As the global batch size (batch_size x num_devices) is an important hyper-parameter, it is recommended to keep the global batch size unchanged for reproduction or adjust the learning rate linearly to a new global batch size.

- Standalone Training

If you want to train or finetune the model on a smaller dataset without distributed training, please run:

```shell
# standalone training on a CPU/GPU/Ascend device
python train.py --config configs/efficientnet/efficientnet_b0_ascend.yaml --data_dir /path/to/dataset --distribute False
```

### Validation

To validate the accuracy of the trained model, you can use `validate.py` and parse the checkpoint path with `--ckpt_path`.

```python
python validate.py -c configs/efficientnet/efficientnet_b0_ascend.yaml --data_dir /path/to/imagenet --ckpt_path /path/to/ckpt
```

### Deployment

Please refer to the [deployment tutorial](https://mindspore-lab.github.io/mindcv/zh/tutorials/inference/) in MindCV.
